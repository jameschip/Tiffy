# Tiffy
Tiffy is a minimal static website generator responsible for creating the flow of 
information on the river. It takes the content created using the [Lizard](https://github.com/jameschip/Lizard) 
syntax and forms the needed html output.

## Tiffy projects

To create a new Tiffy project use the following command:  
  
```tiffy -n```  

A Tiffy project can be created in any directory and has a simple file structure.  
  
/content                    *The directory where the files that define your website contents live.*  
/content/tiffy_loyout.html  *This is the main html layout that is used fot your pages*  
/content/tiffy_layout.css   *This is the default style that is used by Tiffy*
/media                      *This is where you put images and other media that you need*
